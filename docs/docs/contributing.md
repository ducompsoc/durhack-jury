# Contributing

The entire development environment is set up using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). You simply need to have Docker and Docker Compose [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## With Docker (Recommended!)

Copy `.env.template` into `.env` and fill in the environmental variables (see [environmental variables](/docs/intro#step-3-environmental-variables)). Simply run the following command to start up the dev server:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This may take a while to install all files and build, but you should see the following messages in the log when they are done:

Frontend:
```
jury-dev-frontend  | $ vite
jury-dev-frontend  | 
jury-dev-frontend  |   VITE v5.2.2  ready in 327 ms
jury-dev-frontend  | 
jury-dev-frontend  |   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3300/
jury-dev-frontend  |   ➜  Network: http://172.18.0.3:3300/
```

Backend (will show ALL routes):
```
jury-dev-backend   | [GIN-debug] POST   /api/admin/categories     --> server/router.SetCategories (7 handlers)
jury-dev-backend   | [GIN-debug] GET    /api/categories           --> server/router.GetCategories (7 handlers)
jury-dev-backend   | [GIN-debug] GET    /favicon.ico              --> github.com/gin-gonic/gin.(*RouterGroup).StaticFile.func1 (7 handlers)
jury-dev-backend   | [GIN-debug] HEAD   /favicon.ico              --> github.com/gin-gonic/gin.(*RouterGroup).StaticFile.func1 (7 handlers)
```

### [Alternative] Offline database development

If you don't want to create a MongoDB instance or don't want to work online (this only is viable if you've downloaded the packages before), you can use the offline development version. As with above, you will need to create your own `.env` file (again see [environmental variables](/docs/intro#step-3-environmental-variables)). Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-mongo.dev.yml up
```

As with above, you will need to wait for both the backend and frontend to load. Additionally, you will have to wait for the MongoDB database to intialize and create a replica set (takes more than 10 seconds).

### Connecting to the MongoDB Container (running locally)

This is only applicable if you used the `docker-compose-mongo.dev.yml` compose file. Use `mongodb://{MONGODB_USER}:{MONGODB_PASS}@0.0.0.0:27107/?directConnection=true` as the connection string. This works with both MongoDB Compass and through `mongosh`.

To reset the database and reload the sample data, completely remove the `data` folder that the Docker compose creates.

:::info[Note]
If you are using MongoDB Atlas, your connection string will be different. It is easier to see the data from the [MongoDB Atlas Console](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). MongoDB Atlas has connection instructions from `mongosh` [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/mongo-shell-connection/).

## Manual Installation

Although the easiest development environment is through docker compose, you may manually start the frontend and backend separately. 

Requirements:

-   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [go](https://go.dev/)

Copy `.env.template` into `.env` and fill in the environmental variables (same as above). Additionally, copy `client/.env.template` into `client/.env` and copy over the relavent environmental variables from `.env`. This is used to expose the correct environmental variables to the running instance of the Vite frontend as you will not have Docker compose to automatically do that for you.

Client dev server (PORT 3300):

```
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```

Backend dev server (PORT 3301):

```
go run .
```

### Only running frontend

If you wish to ONLY work on the frontend code, you may use the hosted staging app API as your backend, without having to run the Go backend server locally. To do this, go into the `client` folder and make a copy of `client/.env.template` to `client/.env`. You should have the following environmental variables set:

```
VITE_JURY_URL=https://jury-dev.mikz.dev/api
VITE_JURY_NAME=
```

The `VITE_JURY_NAME` field can be anything; it'll be used as the name of the hackathon displayed, but make sure to have the `VITE_JURY_URL` set correctly!

Once you have that setup, from the `client` folder run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

:::warning[Troubleshooting]
If you get the following warning: `error Error: EACCES: permission denied, unlink '<...>/jury/client/node_modules/.yarn-integrity'`, you will need to first remove the `node_modules` folder. Most likely you have run the docker instance before trying this. Docker will transfer ownership of the `node_modules` folder to itself. However, you can simply remove the folder to fix the issue (do `sudo rm -rf node_modules` on UNIX systems).
